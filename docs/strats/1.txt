Polymarket Autotrading. $20,000/month. I tested it with 5 Open-Source Bots.

It didn’t take long to realize manual trading on Polymarket based on gut feelings doesn’t work. It’s not analytics, it’s guessing and losing.

This isn’t about analysis, it’s about expectations and emotions. If your goal is consistent results rather than lucky guesses, you can’t do anything here without data. Polymarket exists in its own environment and doesn’t follow the dynamics of traditional markets. The price of the same event or asset on the platform can differ significantly from what’s happening on centralized exchanges. Looking at Polymarket alone only gives you part of the picture.
To understand what’s really going on, I started comparing Polymarket market behavior with data from major exchanges, especially Binance. I don’t write code myself and I don’t consider myself a developer. Instead, I found several open-source tools on GitHub that already solve key problems: collecting prices, trades, and order books, and syncing data by time. After understanding how they work, I started using them as a foundation for analyzing and testing ideas. I’ll list all these tools below so anyone can study and test them on their own.
Working with historical data quickly revealed an important feature of short markets, especially those around 15 minutes long. You can’t treat the market as a single block of time. Early on, price moves are chaotic, even if it seems “obvious.” Favorites are often overhyped and the outcome probability is barely better than random. As the market approaches closing, things change. Information gradually gets priced in, movements become more meaningful, and the market leader is more likely to hold their position until the end. This shift in efficiency is where a systematic approach becomes possible.
The main takeaway is simple. On Polymarket, you don’t win by guessing better. You win by working with data, understanding the market’s phase structure, and testing ideas in practice. Open-source tools make this path accessible even without coding skills — the key is to take the time to understand and verify everything yourself.
