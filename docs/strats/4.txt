Day 426: Betting “NO” remains a free money glitch.

My PnL from this strategy is now ~$105k and it’s also by far the best way to hedge your airdrops. Here’s why:

> Protected against TGE delays
> Can buy/sell shares anytime
> NO bets are consistently mispriced
> Get exposure to the $POLY airdrop

If you still think betting on Polymarket is pure gambling, take a look at the tweet below where I explain (with data) why NO bets are mispriced.
