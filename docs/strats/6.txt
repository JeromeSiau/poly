I want to share some results and feedback from people who used my @Polymarket
 BTC 15-minute assistant:

1. Supphieros made $253 in profit over 3 days, starting with $40, using basic risk management (5–15% of the deposit per trade).
His strategy was buying low-priced shares and quickly flipping them for profits grindin high volatility

Feedback:
“The bot works great, the data loads very fast, and it has all the indicators needed for comfortable trading. Huge respect for making this, especially since it’s free.”

2. Bigsibas made $324 in profit in 2 days, starting with around $100.
His strategy was different - he bought shares conservatively with bigger size in last 5-9 mins and waited for resolution in most expected scenario.

Feedback:
“You really solved my problem. Before your assistant, I was unfocused and tried to watch Binance and TradingView at the same time, and often missed impulses. With everything in one place, it was a real game changer. And you made it free - big respect.”

Really appreciate all the feedback and messages you’ve been sending me!

I built this assistant mainly to solve my own focus and execution issues, so seeing it help other people in real trades means a lot.
The post with Assistant has already passed 74k views, which honestly surprised me!

Thanks to everyone who tested it, shared results, 
I’m reading everything and will keep improving it step by step.
I'm really glad that i can help people be more effective in their trading and generate more profits!
