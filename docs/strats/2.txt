I analyzed 50 Polymarket bots - here's how they printed $10M+ in 2026.

insane start to 2026 on Polymarket.
bots and whales are absolutely cooking.
i dug into the leaderboard and profiled beasts raking in millions.
top 20 alone stacked over $9M PNL this month, pushing aggregate past $10M easy when you count the volume players.
not hype - straight data from on-chain profiles and real trades.
these aren't gamblers. they're machines hunting mismatches, hedging risks, and compounding non-stop.
let's break it down.
first, the big picture.
Polymarket's exploding with sports, crypto swings, politics inefficiencies.
bots thrive on volume: tiny bets, high reps, low drawdown.
92%+ winrates on thousands of trades.
from my study, AI-built bots spot cex lags, arb spreads, and snipe underdogs.
no emotion, just print.
top categories:

    sports: NBA/NHL over/unders, esports like LoL/CS.
    crypto: 15-min BTC/ETH/SOL ups/downs.
    politics/elections: fed rates, canadian polls, geopolitics, etc.

deep dive on the data.
i scanned 50+ profiles (top leaderboard + hidden gems from X).
80%+ winrate is real if you volume hunt.
here's standout bots/whales by type (checkable profiles):

all real, on-chain.
why bots win?
humans miss the volume.
bots fire 13k+ trades, snag 1-2¢ edges, compound to insanity.
you can try build a bot using AI prompts. no code needed (check my article about Claude bots).
