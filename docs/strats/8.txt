🚨THIS GUY FLIPPED $6 INTO $4 MILLION IN JUST A WEEK!!

This is NOT a clickbait or fake.

If you’re trading on Polymarket, you MUST read it.

He began with around $6-7 and somehow pushed it to ~$4M

He’s not an insider
Not buddies with Trump or Musk
Just a coder who built his own script

I went through his code and ngl, I was shocked
No huge datasets
No crazy complex infrastructure
Nothing close to “rocket science”

I spent roughly 4-6 hours dissecting his whole setup

His FULL strategy:

1. “Free money” through NO bets
The bot hunts near-impossible scenarios and stacks tons of tiny, high-probability wins.
This isn’t gambling - imo it’s more like systematic risk farming

2. Logic arbitrage
If event A clearly leads to event B, and the market hasn’t priced it yet, the bot jumps in instantly.
While u’re still reading the headline, the inefficiency is already gone.
No human can match that speed, tbh

3. The real edge - sports and politics
These markets are packed with retail money + slow, emotional reactions.
The bot lives off the spread, clipping tiny profits from every small mismatch

Scale matters
Tens of thousands of micro trades every month, each bringing just cents.
Stacked over time, they compound into 7 figures

Bottom line
IMO, there’s a silent bot war happening on Polymarket

Crypto markets are already crowded, slow, and fee-heavy,
but sports markets are still pure chaos - easy money for those who automate.
